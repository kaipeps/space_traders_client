# StarPost (SpaceTraders Client)
A user-friendly app to interact with the [SpaceTraders](https://spacetraders.io/)!
## :computer: [Click here](http://space-trade-starpost.surge.sh) to try it out!
## :page_facing_up: About
- StarPost runs off the back of the SpaceTraders API, meaning you need to have an "Agent" registered with them to use it fully.
- On entry, you'll be prompted to enter your authorization token (don't worry, the only place this is stored is on your browser!)
- Enter it in and click "Enter" to see your Agent's details, current contract, and fleet of ships!
## :pencil: Planning & Problem Solving
- Talk about the approach to the problem.
- Add screenshots/drawings of the doodles/plans during the planning phase.
- Flow charts of app logic.
